# Project Description

OutPoll is a comprehensive Polling and Survey Application designed for survey creation, voting, result analysis, and user interaction. This project involves integrating payment functionalities, implementing
a robust user management system, and creating an admin dashboard with role management. The website offers various features for providing a seamless and enriched user experience.
- User Registration and Login: Allows users to create accounts and log in to the platform.
- Survey: The user can see the survey with all information like title, description, votes, comments, and survey results.
- Filtering Options: This enables users to filter surveys by title, category, and vote for easier navigation.
- Payment System: Offers a premium membership for users to be pro-user members
- Participant Engagement: After login, only the user and pro-user roles can participate in a survey. A user is not able to participate in a survey twice. Users can like, dislike, and report in a survey.
- Comment: Only pro users can comment in a survey.
- SweetAlert Notifications: Users receive SweetAlert for successful participation, comments, likes, dislikes, and reports in surveys to enhance user feedback and experience.
- Dashboard: Surveyor can create and update surveys, view pro-user comments, and access survey responses. On the other hand, the admin can manage user roles, unpublish surveys, view pro-user payment history, and access survey responses.
